            <h2>About Dogs</h2>
            <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.</p>

            <h2>Street Dogs</h2>
            <p>
                Street dogs, commonly referred to as stray dogs, are free-roaming dogs that live in urban or rural areas without a permanent home. These dogs often form packs and have adapted to living in harsh conditions, scavenging for food, and seeking shelter in abandoned buildings or public places. Street dogs are a common sight in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries. They can sometimes pose challenges for local communities, including the risk of spreading diseases and aggressive behavior. However, many street dogs are also incredibly resilient, intelligent, and capable of forming strong bonds with humans.

                The life of a street dog can be challenging, as they have to navigate busy streets, avoid dangers, and compete for limited resources. Despite these hardships, many street dogs display remarkable adaptability and survival skills. Organizations and animal welfare groups often work to improve the lives of these animals through spay/neuter programs, vaccinations, and finding homes for adoptable dogs.

                Public perception of street dogs varies widely; some communities regard them as nuisances, while others view them with affection and empathy. Efforts to manage street dog populations humanely include community engagement, education on responsible pet ownership, and support for local shelters and rescue organizations. By understanding and addressing the needs of street dogs, we can work towards creating a more harmonious coexistence between these animals and human populations.
